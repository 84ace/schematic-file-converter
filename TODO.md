=======================================

Development
---------------
* Incorporate part libraries to figure out endpoints


Formats
---------------

KiCad
* Were pretty close
* Needs polish more than anything else

Eagle
* The binary is almost impossible
* Probably need to solve with a ulp

gEDA
* Another pretty bad format, but readable

Fritzing
* The Fritzing guys are helping, so this should be done soon!

Altium
* Thankfully its a ascii format
* We have the parser working, just need to convert it into json

DXDesigner & PADs

OrCad
