Universal Format Converter - TODO List
=======================================

Development
---------------
* Incorporate part libraries to figure out endpoints
* Intelligently guess input and output types, for now assume explicitly given
  partly because most EDA's use '.sch' as the schematic file extension


Formats
---------------

KiCad
* Were pretty close
* Needs polish more than anything else

Eagle
* The binary is almost impossible
* Probably need to solve with a ulp

gEDA
* Another pretty bad format, but readable

Fritzing
* The Fritzing guys are helping, so this should be done soon!

Altium
* Thankfully its a ascii format
* We have the parser working, just need to convert it into json

DXDesigner & PADs
* On the wish list

Alegro
* On the wish list

OrCad
* On the wish list
